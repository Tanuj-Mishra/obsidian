**Software architecture** is the process of designing the overall structure and behavior of a software system. 
It’s a crucial step in the software development process that helps to ensure the system’s quality, maintainability, and scalability. 
Software architecture defines the system’s components, interactions, and their relationships. 
It provides a high-level view of the system, which helps stakeholders understand the system’s design and implementation.
