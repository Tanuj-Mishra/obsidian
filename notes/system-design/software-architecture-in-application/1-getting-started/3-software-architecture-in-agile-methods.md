## The Agile methods
- The Agile methods are iterative and incremental compared to the strict format followed by the waterfall process model. 
- In the waterfall model, it’s assumed that the requirements are final before moving on to the next phase, whereas there’s no such assumption when following Agile methods.
- The Agile manifesto is as follows
	- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	- Working software over comprehensive documentation
	- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	- Responding to change over following a plan
- In Agile processes, the focus is on rapid deliverables, usually within 2–3 weeks, known as **iteration**. Plans evolve very quickly and can change even during an iteration.

## Architecture in Agile
- Terminologies
	- Product backlog
		- work to be done in upcoming iterations.
	- Iteration backlog
		- work to be done in current iteration.
- Approach
	- Create a **flexible and adaptable** foundation for the system that can support the **initial set of features** and can be easily **modified and extended** as the project evolves.
- Reason for this approach
	- As focus of agile is to build a product rapidly, therefore
		- No special iteration is dedicated to it.
		- Moreover, architecture takes shape over iteration, with change in requirement.

### What happens when requirement changes?
- One of the points of the Agile Manifesto states: “**Responding to change over following a plan**.” 
- Therefore, whenever a requirement changes, so will all the relevant design decisions. 
- This will undoubtedly mean more work and lower productivity, but this is only temporary. 
- Usually, bigger architectural decisions don’t change over the course of a project; only minor changes are made to an overall architectural plan.
### Documenting architecture in agile.
- Another point of the Agile Manifesto states: “**Working software over comprehensive documentation**.” 
- Therefore, even though documentation is important and useful to bring all the stakeholders on the same page, the main deliverable at the end of each iteration is (part of) a working software. 
- As a result, most of the time spent during an iteration should be on the actual development of software, rather than on documentation.
___
- However, it’s important to have discussions with stakeholders (customers/product owners) to determine whether something is significant enough to warrant thorough documentation by the development team. 
- Once the customers are satisfied or have granted permission, any documentation related (or unrelated) to the architecture can be completed.
