## What is design?
- What actually is design?
	- According to the dictionary, design can be defined as a verb and also as a noun.
	- Therefore, design as a verb is an activity that will produce a document (i.e., a noun)—such as a sketch or a blueprint—that illustrates the final product’s appearance.
- What is software design?
	- When we make software, we try to visualize it from different angles. We have **class diagrams** (an activity of the design process), **ER models** to discuss database designs and **architectural level designs**—how different components are connected and interact with each other—along with more discussions on the software’s architecture.
- Why do we design software systems? 
	- Because we should think before building anything. That way, if we feel something is wrong, it can be easily erased on paper and redesigned again. Once satisfied with the design, we can start building the product. 
	- Whereas if we start constructing a product without any plan, and in the later stages, we find something that we don’t like, we’ll have to break it with a hammer and reconstruct it again—which will be a lot more costly.
## Design phase in waterfall model
	 ![[waterfall-model.png]]
- One of the most basic approaches to product development in software engineering is the waterfall model. In this process model, logical steps are defined, one step after the other.
- The design phase can also be considered a process of transforming a problem realized during the requirements phase into a solution.

## Points under consideration during design phase
- How should the different components be represented most effectively, so that they’re easily understandable for the different stakeholders?
- What tools and techniques are useful for implementing an architecture that preserves its properties?
- Apart from considering the software aspect, hardware components are also considered.
- How can the nonfunctional requirements of the system be included and handled via different architectural styles?

## Phases in design process
![[software-design-process.png]]
- In architectural design, the focus is on system architecture, in which subsystems are identified, 
- followed by the abstract specification step, in which those subsystems are specified. 
- Interface design is the next step. In simple terms, the user interface is defined during this phase. We also discuss how different system components interact with each other and how external users interact with the system. 
- The component-level design phase decomposes the subsystems into different components, followed by the data structures and algorithms design phase.

## Questions
- what is difference between identifying and specifying the subsystem?
- what are different other model available, why only waterfall is chosen.
- are there any other point for consideration during design phase.
- what is functional and non-functional requirement.
- What tools and techniques are useful for implementing an architecture that preserves its properties?
	- what are the properties, which are being referred here.
