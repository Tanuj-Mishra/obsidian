## Overview
- Modern applications are expected to be available 24 hours a day, from anywhere on the planet, and to operate on almost every device or screen size. 
- Web applications must be adaptable, secure, and scalable to accommodate increased demand. 
- Powerful user experience (UX) built on the client utilizing JavaScript and by efficiently integrating with web APIs should progressively handle complex scenarios.
## Characteristics

### Cloud Hosting
- Applications that have been converted and optimized to run seamlessly in cloud settings are critical to ensuring dependable and robust operations. 
- The capacity to grow in response to demand can assist small firms and start-ups in keeping up with an ever-changing business environment.
- **App resilience**
	- It refers to an app’s capacity to continue operations at a given level despite component or operating cycle failure.
	- After a system breakdown or outage, a resilient app can return to the same visual window with all of its data intact and unaltered
### Cross-Platform usability
- Cross-platform compatible apps are platform-independent.
- Approach
	- If we want to develop an application, we need to pick a technology first, for example Java or Kotlin for Android apps, Swift for iOS apps etc.
- Problem with above approach
	- We’ll be using different programming languages for the same application. 
	- This might lead to compromising the UX because different platforms might have different user interface (UI) elements that could cause app consistency issues
### Traditional and SPA behavior supported
- Traditional approach
	- Every user process treated as a new request. 
	- This means that every time a user wanted a new process to be executed, the whole page or application was reloaded, which slowed down the whole process.
- Modern approach[SPA]
	- Single-page applications (SPAs), these apps execute the required specific area instead of reloading the whole application. 
	- This makes the applications much faster and gives the users a much smoother experience.
- A hybrid app that blends the two behaviors is frequently chosen.

## Questions
- Solution to problem with approach of cross-platform usability.
- not able to understand cloud hosting that much.
- A hybrid app that blends the two behaviors is frequently chosen
	- why hybrid, not only spa?
