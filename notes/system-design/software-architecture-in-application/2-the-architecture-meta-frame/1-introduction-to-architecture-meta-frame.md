- **Architecture drivers** are the considerations that must be made for architecturally significant software systems.
- It is basically a checklist, that defines certain guidelines that define how to perform certain tasks. Using these guidelines, we can see our application, and decide which architectural style suits our needs best.
- Microsoft recommended one of these guidelines, known as the **architecture meta-frame**[Microsoft® Application Architecture Guide, 2nd Edition (Patterns & Practices). 2009. Microsoft Press.]. Similar guidelines can be found within the literature[Maciaszek, Leszek, Tomasz Skalniak, and Grzegorz Biziel. “A meta-architecture for service-oriented systems and applications.” Fourth International Symposium on Business Modeling and Software Design. 2014.] as well.
- It is divided into four parts
	- Scenarios, quality attributes, and requirements/constraints
	- App type, which defines whether the application is a mobile or web application, etc.
	- Architectural style, also known as architectural patterns
	- Architecture frame, which is basically a collection of hotspots
- **Note:** Hotspots are areas that we need to concentrate on from an architectural point of view.
- How to use to analyze our application
	-  By asking simple questions , like for example, how did we provide caching in our application? These questions depend on our use case type, requirements, and constraints, etc.
