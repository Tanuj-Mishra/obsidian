| **Parameter**   | **Public**                                  | **Private**                                    | **Protected**                                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Availability**| Accessible from outside the class.          | Accessible only from within the same class.    | Accessible from the class and its inheritors (derived classes). |
| **Example**     | `public string Color;`                      | `private void TransferFuel();`                 | `protected int EngineTemperature;`             |
| **Car Example** | Color of the car that can be set or read by any external user or service. | Method for transferring fuel from the tank to the engine, hidden from outside. | The engine's internal temperature, accessible to the car class and subclasses like `ElectricCar`. |
| **Use Case**    | When details like car color need to be accessible and modified by others. | When critical functions like fuel transfer should only be managed internally. | When details like engine temperature should be accessed by the car or extended types like `SportsCar`. |
| **Visibility**  | Visible to all other classes.               | Visible only to the `Car` class.               | Visible to the `Car` class and derived classes like `ElectricCar` or `SportsCar`. |
| **Encapsulation** | Low (less restricted)                     | High (more restricted)                          | Moderate (protected access for derived classes) |
| **Modification** | Can be modified from any class or external code. | Can only be modified within the `Car` class. | Can be modified from the `Car` class itself and derived classes like `SUV` or `Convertible`. |
